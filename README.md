The most important file here is estimation.ipynb. This notebook contains the code for estimation of proportions for all the experiments (1-9).

Folders starting from the word 'experiment' contain raw data, notebooks used for preprocessing and preprocessed data.

Notebook spectra_visualisation.ipynb contains code for creating visualisations (included in folder visualisations/).

Notebook AvRE_caluclation.ipynb contains code for computing averaged relative error.

Notebook default_parameters_search.ipynb checks which values of parameters give the least overall error among all the experiments.

In folder heatmaps/ there are visualisations showing influence of kappa_mixture and kappa_components parameters on the quality of estimation.
